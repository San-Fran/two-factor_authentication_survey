I understand the argument that this can lead to a security risk but in the name of convenience I'm sure many people will take this small risk.

Services such as games, email, etc ask the user to authenticate initially but provide users with the aforementioned ""remember this device"" option to not bother them with repeated re authentications.
I don't believe that my sac state log-in needs daily 2FA like my financial institution.
